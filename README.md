A technological invention that makes it simple for educational institutions to handle the student enrollment
process is the student admission management system. It enables admission staff to electronically finish the 
application process, assign students to their courses, monitor shifts, respond to student queries, determine eligibility, 
and follow up with students.The admission management system also enables students to apply online, verify the progress
of their application, upload supporting materials, and make payments for their courses online. The enrolling procedure  
is simplified for students via an effective student management system.A student-friendly form will always have a greater   
completion rate, which helps simplify the admissions process for applicants. Application submitters can: Fill out the admission 
form whenever it's convenient via a student portal, Pay the application cost after choosing a course.I took advantage of my 
knowledge about programming languages like PHP, HTML5, CSS3, and development tools like Visual Studio Code, XAMPP, and Bootstrap 
to create this system. I have also provides the ability to update and remove students's entered details through a user-friendly manner interface.
